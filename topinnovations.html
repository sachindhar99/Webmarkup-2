                        <h2> Top Innovations Of 2020</h2>
                        <p>
                            The pandemic caused global challenges and spurred new inventions. This year was like no other. It was defined by the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world.In response, it created demand like never before. 
                            As the world changed moment-to-moment, we transformed manufacturing facilities to make millions of N95 masks to help health care workers and governments help fight the coronavirus.
                            We also created new technologies to help industries in the short-term combat the pandemic and prepare for the future.</p>

                        <h2> Quantum computing becomes reality </h2>
                        <p>
                           Quantum computing has become a reality, revolutionizing the world of computation. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to process 
                           information using quantum bits or qubits. This enables them to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical counterparts. Key breakthroughs in hardware and algorithms have made this transition 
                           possible. Quantum supremacy has been achieved, demonstrating that quantum computers can outperform classical computers in specific tasks. Industries such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization have been 
                           transformed. Quantum computing's potential to break current encryption standards has prompted a shift towards quantum-safe cryptography. As quantum technology continues to advance, it promises to unlock new frontiers
                            in fields like artificial intelligence, materials science, and climate modeling. However, challenges remain in scaling up quantum hardware and error correction. The reality of quantum computing heralds a new era of 
                            innovation and challenges traditional paradigms of computing.
